    "Answer: In a relational database, a primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key enforces data integrity and ensures that each row in the table is unique. The primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns. The primary key is used as a reference by other tables to create relationships with the table that has the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have two tables: \"orders\" and \"customers\". The \"orders\" table has a column called \"order_id\", which is the primary key of the table. The \"customers\" table also has a column called \"customer_id\", which is the primary key of the table. The \"orders\" table has a column called \"customer_id\", which is a foreign key that refers to the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table. The foreign key creates a relationship between the \"orders\" and \"customers\" tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key creates a relationship between two tables, where the foreign key table is the child table and the primary key table is the parent table. The foreign key is used to ensure data consistency between the child and parent tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the \"orders\" and \"customers\" tables, the \"customer_id\" column in the \"orders\" table is a foreign key that refers to the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table. The foreign key ensures that the \"customer_id\" values in the \"orders\" table correspond to valid \"customer_id\" values in the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table, while a foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The primary key is used to create relationships with other tables, while the foreign key is used to ensure data consistency between related tables."
