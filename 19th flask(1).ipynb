    "Advantages of Flask Framework include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simplicity: Flask is very easy to learn and use, even for beginners. Its API is intuitive and straightforward, making it easy to build web applications quickly and with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flexibility: Flask is a micro-framework, which means it can be used for a wide range of web development tasks, from building small, simple applications to large, complex web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lightweight: Flask has a very small footprint and doesn't require many external dependencies. This makes it easy to install and deploy, even on low-powered devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extensibility: Flask is highly extensible, with a large ecosystem of extensions and plugins that can be used to add functionality to your application. This allows you to easily add features like authentication, database integration, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Testability: Flask is very easy to test, thanks to its lightweight design and clear separation of concerns. This makes it easy to write and run automated tests to ensure the quality of your code."
