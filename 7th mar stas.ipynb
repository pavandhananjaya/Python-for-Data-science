    "    Interpretation:\n",
    "    Covariance does not provide a measure of the strength of the relationship between the variables. A high positive covariance between two variables indicates that they tend to increase or decrease together, but it does not indicate the degree of this relationship.\n",

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "The presence of outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency, such as the mean and the median. If a dataset contains outliers, the mean may be pulled in the direction of the outliers, making it an unreliable measure of central tendency. The median is less affected by outliers, as it represents the value that is in the middle of the dataset, regardless of extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset of salaries of employees in a company. Most employees earn between $30,000 and $80,000, but there are a few outliers who earn more than $1,000,000 per year. In this case, the mean salary would be significantly higher than the median salary, because the outliers are pulling the mean upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "Outliers can also affect measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation. If a dataset contains outliers, the range will be larger than it would be without the outliers. The variance and standard deviation will also be affected by outliers, as these measures are based on the deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset of test scores for a class of students. Most students scored between 60 and 90, but there is one outlier who scored 25. The presence of this outlier will significantly increase the range of the dataset. The variance and standard deviation will also be affected, as they are based on the deviation of each score from the mean. The outlier score of 25 will increase the deviation from the mean, making these measures larger than they would be without the outlier."
