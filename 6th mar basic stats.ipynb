Examples of when descriptive statistics might be used include:\n",

It is the arithmetic average of a dataset, calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is useful for describing the typical value of a dataset, and is sensitive to outliers and extreme values.\n",
    "    Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in order. It is useful for describing the central value of a dataset when the dataset has extreme values or is not normally distributed.\n",

    "    Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides information about the spread of the dataset.\n",
    "    Variance: The variance measures how much the data values vary from the mean. It is calculated by taking the squared difference between each data value and the mean, summing these values, and dividing by the total number of values in the dataset.\n",
    "    Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides information about the spread of the dataset in the same units as the original data. It is more commonly used than variance, as it is easier to interpret and compare.\n",

For example, the mean is useful for describing the typical value of a dataset, while the range is useful for describing the spread of the dataset. The standard deviation is useful for describing the degree of variability in a dataset, while the median is useful for describing the central value of a dataset when the dataset has extreme values. By using multiple measures of central tendency and variability, statisticians can gain a more complete understanding of a dataset and make more informed decisions based on the data."
